Jesse Hirsh delivers keynotes, strategic briefings, and moderated conversations for leaders navigating technological, political, and institutional change. His work focuses on helping decision-makers translate complexity into practical, accountable action.

His farm practice is a systems lens: a real-world discipline for observing feedback loops, resource constraints, and long-horizon stewardship. That lens informs how he approaches policy, governance, and organizational strategy.
