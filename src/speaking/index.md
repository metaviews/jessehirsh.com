# Speaking

If you’re organizing a conference, retreat, summit, or strategic convening, you want more than a “talk.” You want a moment that clarifies what’s happening, shifts how people think, and gives them language they can actually use afterward.

Jesse Hirsh delivers keynotes and facilitated sessions that translate complexity into shared understanding — with energy, precision, and an insistence on practical literacy.

## What audiences leave with

- A framework for making decisions under uncertainty (instead of reacting to headlines)
- Clear language for talking about AI, media systems, and institutional legitimacy without hype
- Better questions — the kind that reshape strategy, policy, and public communication
- A shared map of tensions and trade-offs, so teams stop talking past each other
- A sense of agency: what can be done now, by real people, in real institutions

## Formats

**Keynote (45–60 min)**  
High-energy clarity with a tight narrative arc and strong Q&A.

**Fireside / interview (30–45 min + Q&A)**  
Best for executive audiences or public-facing events that need signal over spectacle.

**Workshop (90–180 min)**  
Hands-on literacy: frameworks, exercises, and group sensemaking.

**Moderation & facilitation**  
Panels, roundtables, and stakeholder conversations designed for emergence, not theatre.

## Core topic areas

- **Future of Authority** — legitimacy, governance, and power in networked society  
- **AI literacy for leaders** — what AI can and cannot do; how to govern it responsibly  
- **Media, disinformation, and democratic resilience** — attention systems, narratives, polarization  
- **Agroecology as systems thinking** — food systems as governance; resilience as design
