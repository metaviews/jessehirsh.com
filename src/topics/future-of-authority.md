# Future of Authority

Authority is not a personality trait. It’s a design problem.

In a networked society, legitimacy is manufactured, contested, and hacked — through platforms, narratives, institutions, and everyday interactions. This talk helps audiences understand how authority is produced now, why it’s destabilizing, and what it means for governance, leadership, and public trust.

## Who this is for

Leaders and organizers working in government, education, civic institutions, regulated industries, media, and any organization navigating polarization, institutional fatigue, and rapid technological change.

## Audience takeaways

- A clear model of how authority and legitimacy are produced in platform society
- Why “trust” fails as a strategy — and what to build instead
- How narratives function as infrastructure for governance and public compliance
- How institutional voice can regain credibility without slipping into propaganda
- Practical questions leaders can use to stress-test decisions and communications

## Sample titles

- **Authority Is a Design Problem**
- **Legitimacy in the Age of Platforms**
- **From Trust to Literacy: Governing the Attention Economy**

## Best formats

Keynote; fireside; executive retreat; moderated stakeholder conversation; workshop on institutional narrative and legitimacy.
