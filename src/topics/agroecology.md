# Agroecology as Systems Thinking

The farm is a living lab for complexity: feedback loops, resilience, coordination, and the limits of control. Agroecology isn’t just a farming method — it’s a governance lens.

This talk uses food systems to make complex institutional challenges legible: supply chains, public trust, risk, innovation, and resilience under climate pressure.

## Who this is for

Agri-food leaders, policy audiences, sustainability audiences, educators, municipal/regional planners, and anyone working on resilience.

## Audience takeaways

- Why resilience is designed (and why efficiency can make systems brittle)
- Food systems as an “attention system”: what gets noticed, funded, and governed
- What open innovation and open infrastructure mean in practice
- How local experimentation scales through networks, not command
- A fresh language for talking about sustainability without cliché

## Sample titles

- **Feeding Possibility**
- **Resilience as Design**
- **The Farm as a Governance Laboratory**

## Best formats

Keynote; fireside; workshop; facilitated conversation across stakeholders.
