# Media, Disinformation, and Democratic Resilience

Disinformation isn’t just “bad information.” It’s an adaptive strategy inside attention systems that reward outrage, speed, and identity conflict.

This talk reframes disinformation as a governance problem: how institutions speak, how publics form beliefs, and how narratives compete in fragmented media environments.

## Who this is for

Public institutions, NGOs, educators, journalists, researchers, and any organization that must communicate credibly under polarization.

## Audience takeaways

- Why “fact-checking” is necessary but insufficient
- How attention incentives shape what becomes “true” in public life
- The difference between misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, and narrative warfare
- Practical communication moves that reduce backlash and increase comprehension
- How to build resilience through literacy, transparency, and participatory sensemaking

## Sample titles

- **The Supply Chain of Attention**
- **Disinformation as Governance**
- **How Narratives Capture Institutions**

## Best formats

Keynote; workshop for comms teams; moderated stakeholder sessions; panels and roundtables.
