# AI Literacy for Leaders

Most organizations are being forced into “AI decisions” without the literacy to know what they’re actually buying, building, or delegating. That gap creates waste, reputational risk, and avoidable governance failures.

This talk gives leaders a usable framework for understanding AI capabilities, limitations, and political economy — and how to deploy it in ways that serve real needs.

## Who this is for

Executives, boards, public-sector leaders, policy teams, comms teams, and program managers who need practical clarity without hype.

## Audience takeaways

- What AI is (and isn’t) — explained in decision-grade terms
- Where AI creates value vs where it creates fragility and dependency
- How to evaluate AI projects and vendors without getting dazzled
- Why data governance matters more than “innovation” rhetoric
- How to communicate AI decisions to staff, stakeholders, and the public

## Sample titles

- **AI Without the Hype**
- **Governing Automation**
- **The Literacy Gap: Why Most AI Projects Fail**

## Best formats

Keynote for broad audiences; workshop for leadership teams; fireside conversation paired with Q&A.
